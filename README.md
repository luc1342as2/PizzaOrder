Here's what I focused on:
Customizable Orders: Users can select pizza size, toppings, and quantity, with real-time updates to the order summary and pricing.
Interactive Features: JavaScript powers the dynamic elements, ensuring seamless updates to selections and accurate cost calculations.
User-Friendly Design: I created a clean, intuitive layout using HTML and CSS, making the application easy to navigate and visually appealing.
Skill Development: This project showcases my expertise in front-end development and creating responsive, interactive user experiences.
